ORE and wildcard based middlebox
# Privacy-preserving Packet Header Checking over In-the-Cloud Middleboxes
## Introduction:
This work introduces a middlebox system that can perform encrypted header matching based network functions. It leverages the latest practical primitives for search over encrypted data, i.e., searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) ,order-revealing encryption (ORE) and wildcard based Fuzzy Searchable Encryption(FSE). To mitigate recent inference attacks on ORE schemes, this work protects the order information during header matching inspection, and presents a rule-aware size reduction technique to achieve better performance.
